<br> Recently, I've become a passionate fan of Riichi Mahjong, a Japanese variant of the ancient Chinese game of mahjong. It's a highly intense and exciting game that combines game theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic modeling.

## Animes & Visual Novels

<br> I'm a huge fan of animes and visual novels. Essentially, I enjoy the boundless imagination they convey. My favorite anime is *Hunter Ã— Hunter* and my favorite visual novel is *Raging Loop*.
